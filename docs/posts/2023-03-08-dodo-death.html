<h2>The story</h2>
<p>Giles is trying to rise through the ranks of barber-surgeons in late 19th
century London. He’s looking to publish a book on anatomy that will blow
everyone’s minds. The book would contain more detailed illustrations of the
human body and would be considered a step forward. But to do this, he needs a
large amount of bodies to study so he can understand the differences and
commonalities between them.</p>
<p>Geraldine wants to be a certified pilot. She’s been taking flying lessons and
is finally out on her own, practicing some of what she’s learned. She had seen
a beautiful forest near her practice field. She thinks she saw a hidden lake in
the middle so she decides to deviate her path while flying and see what the
forest looks like from above. Except a canada goose flies from the lake and
straight into her propellers. Her plan crashes and she ends up in Giles’
office.</p>
<p>Giles is delighted to see Geraldine arrive to his office with a broken arm.
He’s been working on a drawing of the human arm but he’s mostly had male … erm
… models for it. One had waltzed into his office for a shave but got more than
he bargained for. How interesting it would be to study a female arm up close.</p>
<p>Geraldine is conscious but in a lot of pain. Giles has a disturbing glint in
his eye, like he’s found a treasure. Is this man going to flirt with her? In
this state? She decides to speak:</p>
<p>"Where am I?" she asks.</p>
<p>"You’re in my office. My name is Giles, I’m going to have a look at your arm"</p>
<p>"Oh I see. Why am I covered in feathers?" she asks.</p>
<p>"I was hoping you could tell me that", he answered.</p>
<p>"This is not my blood"</p>
<p>"Let’s take a closer look", he gleefully whispered next to her ear.</p>
<p>Geraldine feels slightly dizzy as she moves onto a bed. She can hear Giles move
around in the background, moving a lot of trays with metal tools in them. She’s
wondering why he’s looking for tools instead of trying to put her arm back in
place.</p>
<p>"Right, I’ve found my stethoscope and scalpel. Shall I have a look?", Giles
asked.</p>
<p>"Why do you need the scalpel? I told you this isn’t my blood."</p>
<p>"Well I won’t be able to confirm that until I’ve cut through your sleeve"</p>
<p>"But the arm isn’t broken near my sleeve, it seems to be broken at the elbow.
What exactly do you want to find out?"</p>
<p>"I think you might be feeling a bit hysterical. I’m going to give you some
smelling salts to calm your nerves. Here, hold this to your face."</p>
<p>"I’m not sure I understand why you need to do this."</p>
<p>She’s stalling for time now. Something doesn’t feel right about this man. She
tells him she’s allergic to smelling salts and requests a different way to be
numbed.</p>
<p>While he skulks away, she follows him with his gaze. He opens the door to
another room. In her state, she can see a painting of Giles with what looks
like a deceased patient. He’s sitting over the patient, smiling and studying
him up close. This was disturbingly like his posture when he reached down to
whisper in her ear.</p>
<p>She panics and desperately looks around for a way to escape. She sees a small
kitchen at the end of the room with a large stuffed dodo bird. This man has
excentric tastes. The large fat bird is next to a window. She could make a run
for it and climb the bird to get to the window. In one big jump, she could be
out.</p>
<p>She makes a go for it. Her heart is pounding, the goose blood makes her hands
feel sticky and feathers start flying off of her as she goes across the room.</p>
<p>Giles is alerted and sees her heading towards the dodo. He starts screaming at
her to stay away from his dodo: That was an expensive gift! How dare you!</p>
<p>One, two, three steps and she’s on the ledge. Yes! Freedom! All she has to do
is jump down from the second floor, she can clear it.</p>
<p>The dodo’s head snapped off while she was stepping on him and is hooked on her
coat. It’s pinned her to the window. She makes a jump for it, but falls back on
the office.</p>
<p>A scream can be heard from the street: “Goddamn birds!”</p>
